You are going to generate a clean handoff prompt for a new chat.

Your task:

Create a structured, concise handoff prompt that will allow a new assistant to fully understand:

What syscopilot currently is

What phase the project is in

The active goal

The architectural constraints

The current codebase structure

The collaboration model (Codex writes code, ChatGPT designs)

Rules:

Do not include meta commentary.

Do not explain why the prompt exists.

Do not include duplication.

Keep it structured and readable.

Keep it under 500 lines.

Make it authoritative and clear.

Do not invent features that do not exist.

If something is unclear, ask me before generating.

Before generating the handoff, first summarize your understanding of the current project state in 5–10 bullet points.

After I confirm, generate the final handoff prompt.
